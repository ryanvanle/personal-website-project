# AI usage
Used AI, Google Gemini 2.5, to generate the background water effect, and edges on the border, then general debugging, filtering, CSS polish, and importing content from like resume / video scripts to JSONs to Javascript functions to generate HTML elements and Project Descriptions.

General Note, about my thoughts on AI web development:

Since most of my development background is on it but did not use it that often to the extent of trying to meet a deadline fast while making a good website. I think it is really good for doing tedious things like making HTML from JS or JSON, but it is ridiculously hard to manage and overall produces sloppy code in-terms of code structure and like output. It does not follow good general practices, like wrapping the JS so you cannot directly access global variables or any accessibility practices (semantic tags or alt text or any ARIA tagging).

However, I think for the first time using AI extensively for this project, I find that it is very efficient since a lot of the tedious tasks can be done in minutes compared to like a hour normally to do it. For example, the background water effect was very shocking because I would not be able to do it given days but it did it in minutes. It also rickrolled me when I was converting like video transcripts into projects and when putting in my actual links because it eventually just put a youtube link I did not put and then rickrolled me. There is more to rant about here in terms of philosophy and AI, but it is definitely good enough now to be used extensively.
