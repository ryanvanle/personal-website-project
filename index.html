              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                Hello, I'm Ryan Le (He/Him)! I am a Computer Engineering Student who is about to graduate from University of Washington.
                I specialize and primary focus on technology that enhances the Human Experience, which includes fields such as Full-Stack Development, Accessibility, UI/UX Design, Prototyping, and Virtual Reality.
                I previously interned at Amazon, as a Software Development Engineer, working on the Gift Card Experience Team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of schooling and work, I enjoy watching TV shows, playing video games, and learning random non-important but fulfilling skills such as shuffling cards.
              </p>

              <p>
                Currently, I am actively prototyping a high-potential video game idea and assembling a game studio to hopefully create the game end-to-end. I am taking a break as well to celebrate graduating and establish a foundation for the future.
